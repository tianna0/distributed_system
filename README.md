# Raft REST Message Queue
A reliable distributed message queue built with the Raft consensus algorithm. RRMQ exposes a REST API for adding (PUT) and consuming (GET) messages from topic-based FIFO queues. The system ensures consistency, replication, and fault tolerance across nodes, with messages consumed exactly once.
